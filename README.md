# -Image-Steganography-Project-Python

This repository contains a Python project for image steganography, which allows users to hide secret messages within images.

# Description:
The Image-Steganography-Project-Python repository includes Python scripts for encoding secret messages into images and decoding hidden messages from images. Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information within other non-secret data, such as images, audio files, or text. In this project, we focus on hiding text messages within images without visibly altering the image's appearance. The encoding process embeds the message into the least significant bits of the image pixels, while the decoding process extracts the hidden message from the modified image.

# Features:

Encoding: Embedding text messages into images using steganographic techniques.
Decoding: Extracting hidden messages from steganographically encoded images.
Support for various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and BMP.
User-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the steganography functionalities.
Encryption options to enhance the security of hidden messages, if desired.
Detailed documentation and usage instructions for easy understanding and implementation.

# Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file, if any.
Run the provided Python scripts to perform encoding and decoding operations.
Follow the instructions provided in the project documentation to encode a message into an image and decode a hidden message from an image.
Experiment with different images and messages to explore the capabilities of image steganography.
